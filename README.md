# Caboose Simulator
With the power of computers, we will finally train an amoebalike cyber-Caboose to live deliciously. _Ad astra per aspera; one thought per sometimes._

### Overview
Use LSTM-RNNs to allow simulated creatures to learn from prior experiences and adapt to their environment. Godot's object framework will be used to facilitate inter-process communication, interaction evaluation, and auxiliary tracking functionality. Visualization tools (including live renderer, UI, and NN dashboard) will be developed in Godot.

### Software Versioning
AUX: Godot 4.4.1., Stable distribution for Linux. GDScript and C++ through GDExtensions.
RNN: Whatever works, honestly.
